MiniRazor is a tiny wrapper around the Razor templating engine, which provides a way to compile and render templates on demand. This library focuses specifically on providing the lightest possible implementation that can be used in console, desktop, or other non-web applications.

## Download

- [NuGet](https://nuget.org/packages/MiniRazor): `dotnet add package MiniRazor`

## Features

- Easy to use, no need to assemble massive configurations for Roslyn or Razor yourself
- Full support of all C# features in templates, including `async`/`await`
- No dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` shared framework or runtime
- Works with .NET Standard 2.0+

## Usage

### Simple usage

The following example compiles a template and renders it using a model:

```csharp
var engine = new RazorTemplateEngine();

// Compile template (you may want to cache this instance)
var template = engine.Compile("<p>Hello, @Model.Subject!</p>");

// Render template
var result = await template.RenderAsync(new MyModel { Subject = "World" });

// -- result:
// <p>Hello, World!</p>
```

The entry point, `RazorTemplateEngine` is responsible for compiling Razor templates into IL code. Each compilation creates a new dynamic assembly, so it's strongly recommended to cache compiled templates as much as possible. You are free to choose how you want to do that.

Once compiled, the template can be rendered as many times as needed. Keep in mind that the `RenderAsync` method is asynchronous to facilitate templates that contain asynchronous method invocations in them.

### Anonymous model

You can also use an anonymous model as well:

```csharp
var result = await template.RenderAsync(new { Foo = "Bar" });
``` 

### Referencing internal types

Sometimes you may want to reference internal types in a template. Normally, since the template is compiled into a separate dynamic assembly in memory, it can't access internal types defined in other assemblies.

You can work around this, however, by using the `InternalsVisibleTo` attribute on the assembly that contains those internal types. The assembly name generated by the template engine is not deterministic, but you can specify your own:

```csharp
var engine = new RazorTemplateEngine("RazorTemplateAssembly");

// ...
// Add this attribute to the assembly whose internal types you want to expose to the template
[assembly: InternalsVisibleTo("RazorTemplateAssembly")]
```

### Statically-typed model

In order to have code completion inside a template, you need to let the IDE know what type of model it expects. In regular Razor templates you would do that via the `@model` directive, however with MiniRazor you need to use `@inherits` instead:

```razor
@inherits MiniRazor.RazorTemplateBase<MyModel>

<p>Statically-typed model: @Model.Foo</p>
```

### HTML-encoding

Output rendered with Razor templates is HTML-encoded by default. If you want to print raw HTML content, for example if it's sourced from somewhere else, you can use the `Raw()` method:

```razor
@{
    string GetHtml() => "<p>Hello world!</p>";
}

@GetHtml() // &lt;p&gt;Hello world!&lt;/p&gt; 
@Raw(GetHtml()) // <p>Hello world!</p>
```
